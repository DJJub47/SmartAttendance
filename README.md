# Smart Attendance

## Welcome
This is the repository for the Smart Attendance app, made as a submission for the Full Sail Emerging Technology Scholarship (ETS).

## How does this fulfill the program requirements for the scholarship?
The requirements of the ETS program were to create a program that demonstrated significant use of a programming language, a program that demonstrates significance, demonstrates originality, and solves a real-world problem. While there are many attendance apps on the market, few, if any, of them seem to allow users to store important data such as addresses, birthdays, allergy information, etc. all in the one app. Normally, users would have to use several different programs to take attendance, check and update student information, and other such things. Smart Attendance allows all of this.

Another requirement of the ETS program was to have a screencast explaining how to navigate the technology. That can be found [here]() (WIP).
